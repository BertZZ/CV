## Bertie Wooles

I am a full stack developer, prefering to work with back end and logic.
I am only 24 and still trying to find my way in the world. That is why I joined Makers Academy in April 2017 to start my journey towards becoming a software developer. In just 12 weeks I have learnt about building Web Apps in Ruby, such as my attempt to make a basic [Twitter Clone](https://github.com/BertZZ/chitter-challenge), and writting Javascript code which I used to recreate PacMan for my final project, [Project BYO-Man](https://github.com/BertZZ/project_byoman)

## Skills

#### Teamwork

I have been working in teams for a lot whilst at Makers Academy. During one of the team project weeks at Makers academy my team said that I was able to keep them on track by advocating sticking to the XP values we are taught in the course. Also during my final project we communicated very effectivly to build a clone of PacMan in 2 weeks with no frameworks or Libraries. That Repo can be found here: [Project BYO-Man](https://github.com/BertZZ/project_byoman) and a live demo of the game can be found [here](https://project-byo-man.herokuapp.com/)


#### Quick to Learn new Skills
Before coming to Makers Academy I had no coding skills at all. Now in just 12 weeks I have developed a good understanding of both Ruby and Javascript and the technologies surrounding them such as Rails and Node.js. Whilst Ruby and Javascript are the 2 languages taught at Makers, the course also teaches you how to learn as well as just how to code. Because of this I am confident that I could pick up any language required to solve the problem at hand in a short space of time

## Interests
I play all kinds of Games. Strategy games, board games and card games like Magic The Gathering, all of which help to improve my critical thinking and decision making skills, all of which is helpful when trying to solve code problems. I enjoy watching Rugby and playing Table Tennis.
